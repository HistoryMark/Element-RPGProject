Amateur JRPG Project
Elemental Harmony
A JRPG by Mark Perez
Made with RPG Maker MV Engine
---------------------------------------------------------------
Elemenal Harmony is an amateur work-in-progress JRPG that i'm making with the RPG Maker MV engine with a couple of javascript plugins borrowed from Yanfly's Engine Plugins. Site for Yanfly's Plugins for RPG Maker MV(http://yanfly.moe/yep/) (All scripts made under the Yanfly Engine Core and the Core itself is the property of Yanfly).

All different aspects such as audio, animation, battle system, saves, etc. are separated into their respective folders included in the World_of_Eon_Project.zip and any changes to be applied must upload changes to a specific folder to update the entire project folder to the Project Head (HistoryMark).
